# Security-Enhanced Spring Boot Application

## Project Overview

This project is designed as an educational journey into the world of web application security, with a specific focus on Spring Boot applications. 
The primary goal is to deepen understanding and practical skills in implementing various security concepts and measures; JWTs (JSON Web Tokens), Spring Security, filter chains, key management, encryption and decryption, HttpOnly cookies, and other related security concepts.
The application has a SPA built in react which can be found **to-be-published**. 

The project also makes use of Flyway, Postgresql, Docker etc.


## Some Key Concepts Explored

- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** Implementing JWT for secure and stateless authentication.
- **Spring Security:** Leveraging Spring Security for robust security configurations.
- **Filter Chains:** Understanding and customizing Spring Security filter chains for specific security needs.
- **Key Management:** Managing encryption keys securely within the application.
- **Encryption & Decryption:** Safeguarding sensitive data through encryption and understanding the decryption process.
- **HttpOnly Cookies:** Utilizing HttpOnly cookies to enhance security by restricting access to cookie data via JavaScript.
- **Advanced Security Practices:** Exploring additional security mechanisms and best practices in web application development.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as a standard Spring Boot application, with modules and packages organized to reflect different aspects of security implementation. Key areas include:

- **Authentication and Authorization:** Handling user identity verification and access control.
- **Token Management:** Managing the lifecycle of JWTs, including creation, validation, and blacklisting.
- **Security Filters:** Custom filters to process security-related tasks in the application's filter chain.
- **Encryption Utilities:** Tools for encrypting and decrypting data, along with key management utilities.
- **Controller Implementations:** REST API endpoints demonstrating secure practices in data handling and response management.

## Learning Outcomes

This project serves as a practical guide to understanding and implementing various security features in a Spring Boot application. It provides real-world scenarios for handling security concerns and offers insights into the intricacies of web application security.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:** Begin by cloning the repository to your local machine.
2. **Explore the Code:** Navigate through the various packages to understand how different security concepts are implemented.
3. **Run the Application:** Use your IDE or command line to run the application and test its features.
4. **Experiment:** Feel free to modify, extend, or experiment with different security configurations and scenarios.

## Feedback
